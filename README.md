# DeepL Translate Github Action

This action uses the [DeepL Translate API](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-node) to translate text files in your repository to your target languages. The output will follow the file extension of the given input file.

## Features

ðŸ˜Ž Since DeepL API does not officially support markdown tag handling yet, it helps to mitigate some issues that DeepL may have when it comes to markdown documents.

âœ¨ In v1.0.0, **HTML-like files** such as `.md | .html | .xml` are supported.
âœ¨ From v2.0.0 onwards, **locale JSON** files are also supported.
